# instoter
When I use IFTTT for instagram to twitter, as a very active Instagram user, my Twitter timeline is like a spam box. I need a service can slow down sync from Instagram, and there is the service application. Instoter tweet your Instagram 4 photos each time, so you Twitter timeline will looks clean then before.
