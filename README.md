# instoter
When I use IFTTT for instagram to twitter, as a very active Instagram user, my Twitter timeline is like a spam box. I need a service can slow down sync from Instagram, and there is the service application. Instoter tweet your Instagram 4 photos each time, so you Twitter timeline will looks clean then before.

# Product idea
1. Login twitter account and Instagram account
2. Subscript Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/developer/subscriptions/)
3. 4 photos is ready then post the photos to twitter as a gallery

# TODO
