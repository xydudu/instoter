# instoter
When I use IFTTT for instagram to twitter, as a very active Instagram user, my Twitter timeline is like a spam box. I want a service can slow down sync from Instagram, and there is it. Instoter collect your Instagram photos by day, so you Twitter timeline will looks clean then before.

# Product idea
1. Login twitter account and Instagram account
2. Subscript Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/developer/subscriptions/)
// 3. 4 photos is ready then post the photos to twitter as a gallery
4. daily ins-photos is a good idea...
5. Evnet triggered when 4 photos are ready and cron job every day
